📈 Visualizations: Created various visualizations, including bar charts and gauges.
🌍 Demographics: Analyzed how different demographics impact salary and job satisfaction.
🎨 Custom Themes: Developed a unique color scheme and theme for the dashboard.
Key Insights
📊 Visualization Variety: Employing different types of visualizations (bar charts, cards, etc.) allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the data from multiple perspectives, catering to different audience needs.
📈 Demographic Impact: Analyzing how factors like country and job title influence salary can guide strategic decisions in hiring and salary negotiations within organizations.
🎨 Customization in Dashboards: A well-designed dashboard with a unique theme not only enhances visual appeal but also improves user engagement and data interpretation.
