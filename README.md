**PROJECT 1** 

**The Olympics** 

**Situation:** 

The Olympic Games have a rich history spanning over a century, with vast amounts of data on athlete participation, medal distributions, and global representation. This data held potential for deep insights but was complex and unstructured, making it challenging to analyze and visualize effectively.

**Task:** 

My goal was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Olympic data using Power BI. I aimed to uncover trends in global participation, analyze medal distributions, and visualize the evolution of the Olympics over time. Additionally, I wanted to create a system for quantifying and comparing countries' Olympic performances.

**Action:**
1.	**Data Collection and Cleaning**: 

    Imported extensive Olympic datasets into Power BI

    Used Power Query to clean and structure the data, ensuring accuracy for analysis
  	
2. **Visualization Development:**

    Created various charts and graphs to display participation trends

    Developed an animated map to show the historical progression of Olympic participation
   
    Designed matrix charts for medal count analysis

3. **Analysis Techniques:**

    Implemented a point system to quantify countries' Olympic successes

    Linked multiple datasets to explore correlations between demographics, national investments, 
    and Olympic performance

    Conducted breakdowns of athlete performance by sport, gender, and age

4. **Insight Generation:**

    Analyzed the shift from Eurocentric to global participation

    Examined factors contributing to national Olympic success

    Investigated trends in athlete demographics and performance over time

**Result:** 

The project yielded several significant outcomes:

1.	Comprehensive Visualization: Successfully created a dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard that effectively visualized the evolution of the Olympics from 1896 to present.
2.	Trend Identification: Uncovered key trends, such as the globalization of the Olympics and shifts in dominant countries over time.
3.	Performance Metrics: Developed a robust system for quantifying and comparing national Olympic performances, providing new insights into country rankings beyond simple medal counts.
4.	Demographic Insights: Revealed patterns in athlete age, gender, and nationality across different sports and over time.
5.	Data-Driven Storytelling: Transformed complex Olympic data into an engaging, visual narrative that makes the rich history and trends of the Games accessible and understandable.
6.	Skill Enhancement: Significantly improved my proficiency in Power BI, data cleaning, advanced data analysis, and data visualization techniques.

This project not only deepened my understanding of Olympic history and trends but also demonstrated the power of data analysis in bringing complex sporting events to life through visualization.

**PROJECT 2**

**Data Professionals Survey**

In this Power BI project, I created a dashboard using real survey data from data professionals, focusing on data transformation and visualization.

Highlights

üìä Real Data: Utilized survey data collected from 600-700 data professionals.

üîÑ Data Transformation: Focused on using Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.

üìà Visualizations: Created various visualizations, including bar charts and gauges.

üåç Demographics: Analyzed how different demographics impact salary and job satisfaction.

üé® Custom Themes: Developed a unique color scheme and theme for the dashboard.

Key Insights

üìä Visualization Variety: Employing different types of visualizations (bar charts, cards, etc.) allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the data from multiple perspectives, catering to different audience needs.

üìà Demographic Impact: Analyzing how factors like country and job title influence salary can guide strategic decisions in hiring and salary negotiations within organizations.

üé® Customization in Dashboards: A well-designed dashboard with a unique theme not only enhances visual appeal but also improves user engagement and data interpretation.

ü§ù Survey Insights: Understanding job satisfaction metrics, like work-life balance and salary happiness, provides valuable feedback for companies to improve employee satisfaction and retention.
